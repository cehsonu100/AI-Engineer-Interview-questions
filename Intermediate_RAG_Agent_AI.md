## 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- **Q1.** Can you explain how Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) works and how you’ve implemented it in your past projects?  
- **Q2.** If your RAG system begins returning inconsistent or low-quality results, what debugging steps would you take?  
- **Q3.** What has been your experience with vector databases like Pinecone, ChromaDB, or FAISS? How do you decide which one to use?  
- **Q4.** How do you optimize the performance of a vector similarity search in a RAG-based system?

## 2. Large Language Models (LLMs) & Fine-Tuning

- **Q5.** Describe your experience fine-tuning a large language model. What frameworks and datasets did you use, and how did it impact model performance?  
- **Q6.** How do you compare and benchmark different LLMs such as GPT, LLaMA, and Claude for a given task?

## 3. Agentic AI & AI Agent Design

- **Q7.** How quickly can you build a basic AI agent system using minimal tools and frameworks like LangGraph? Could you estimate the time required and justify the trade-offs involved?  
- **Q8.** LangGraph is built on top of which core libraries or frameworks?  
- **Q9.** When designing an AI agent system:  
  - Do you typically create the agent flow yourself or follow a specification provided by a manager, lead, or client?  
  - If you design it yourself, what are your intuitive thought processes?  
  - How do you approach building an effective, modular, and scalable agent system from scratch?

## 4. Testing, Evaluation & LLMOps

- **Q10.** How did you build a test data pipeline for ML model evaluation, and which metrics did you use to determine success?

---

## 5. Behavioral & System Thinking

- **Q11.** Describe a challenging Generative AI project you’ve worked on. What technical and non-technical obstacles did you face, and how did you overcome them?  
- **Q12.** When you are building a GenAI-based application, how do you balance performance, accuracy, and hallucination control?

## 6. Deep Dive: Self-RAG vs Auto-RAG

- **Q13.** Can you explain the core difference between Self-RAG and Auto-RAG? Which use cases are they best suited for?  
- **Q14.** Imagine a scenario where your current system uses Self-RAG but struggles with multi-hop questions. How would you redesign it using Auto-RAG principles?  
- **Q15.** What are the pros and cons of Auto-RAG in production environments, especially regarding latency, cost, and reasoning depth?  
- **Q16.** Describe how Auto-RAG determines when to stop retrieving. How would you implement such control in your own pipeline?
